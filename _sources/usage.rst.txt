Environment Setup
-------------------

To start setup, first navigate to the code/ directory ::

   cd code

Then run the following bash script ::

   ./laura_setup.sh

Driver Usage
-------------

The driver takes one argument with the --config flag. Run the following in the code/ directory from above. ::
   
   python laura_driver.py --config [CONFIG_PATH]

Configs are typically stored in the code/configs folder. Example usage with the default config is included below. ::

   python laura_driver.py --config configs/default_config.ini


Config Schema
--------------

The config is comprised of three sections: Settings, Sections, and SpERT.

Settings
^^^^^^^^^

- working_dir - the directory where all data is stored to and processed
- max_results - the maximum number of publications downloaded using the data scraper module
- keywords - a list of keywords delimited by commas, describing the keywords used to query for publications to scrape
- visualization - choose between wordcloud, pyldavis, and scatter
- JAR_loc - location of CERMINE JAR file. Do not change unless familiar with CERMINE.
- lda_num_topics - integer describing number of topics used for LDA
- http_directory - visualization directory containing relevant visualization scripts. Do not change unless the relative path was changed.

Sections
^^^^^^^^^
This section is used in order to run specific modules of the pipeline, or run all. Set these sections to yes/no based on which to run. If "yes" is set for "all", this setting will override individual section settings.

SpERT
^^^^^^
spert_config - The SpERT config goes here. This is necessary for SpERT to run in the pipeline. Do not modify this path unless experienced with SpERT, or the path was changed.
